# Python Fibbonacci calculation script

## Fibbonacci utilities

They can be used for many aplications, eg: if you divide ()n / n - 1) where n is a position, you get an aproximated value of Phi number, when the number is bigger, the best aproximation you get.

*Phi is: (1 + sqrt( 5 ) ) / 2*

## Where r my fucking numbers!
- Numbers calculated are writen to a file created by the script.

- Beware of keep running the file so much time. The file can get weight of gigabytes in minutes.

## Moar stuff
- Saving data as json? (Difficulty at parsing the json object)
- Saving numbers as array?
- Only saving the last 2 numbers?
